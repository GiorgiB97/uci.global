                    investment offerings.<br>
                    By accessing the UCI website and / or buying shares in UCI, you agree to be bound by the Terms and

                <p><strong>Risk Warning:</strong></p>
                <p>Shareholders invest for the sole benefit and at the risk of the shareholder. The value of investments

                    returns. The value of any securities denominated in a foreign currency will be influenced by the
                    rate of exchange used to convert them back into your base currency.</p>
