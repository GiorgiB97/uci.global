                                Dear UCI shareholders,<br> <br>I wanted to give you this update about our recent
                                activities.
                            </h4>

                                Securities and

                                Commission rulings to launch the new share offering / shareholder platform in the USA.
                                UCI will
                                be regulated under the Private Offering Program rules that allow us to raise up to
                                $50,000,000
                                within an initial 12 months by legally soliciting, promoting and advertising to
                                investors within
                                the USA.<br> <br>We are almost ready to begin and are now only waiting for updated
                                corporate documents
                                that need
                                to be apostilled.<br> <br>When the new portal / platform is live, the account managers
                                will quickly add all pending
                                shares
                                to each shareholder account.<br> <br>UCI Team: I have been engaged in bringing VIP
                                individuals onto the advisory team for
                                UCI.<br> <br>I am happy to announce that I recently signed an agreement with Mr. David
                                Drake who
                                brings
                                exceptional leadership and experience.<br> <br>Here is a summary of his influence.<br>
                                David Drake is a well-known entrepreneur, investor, and speaker. Through his family
                                office, LDJ
                                Capital, and his partners, David’s investments currently have over fifty global
                                directors that
                                maintain relations with institutions and family offices with $1.5 trillion in assets. He
                                has
                                represented the US Commerce Department at the Transatlantic Forum with the EU Commission
                                in
                                Brussels and Rome, as well as in the UK Parliament as a speaker.<br>
                                David’s seminal work in the Crowdfunding Industry has led to an invitation to the White
                                House
                                Champions of Change ceremony. He and his financial media company, The Soho Loft Media
                                Group, set
                                up the first ever crowdfunding meeting with SEC and FINRA in April 2012, shortly after
                                then
                                President Barack Obama signed the JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) Act into law.
                                Alongside
                                other pioneers, he created the CfPA or Crowdfunding Professional Association, which
                                later gave
                                birth to the CFIRA or Crowdfunding Intermediary Regulatory Advocates. These two national
                                associations have dealt with SEC and FINRA on a weekly basis for the past five
                                years.<br>
                                David will commence his activities with UCI in the very near future.<br>
                                My goal is to have several high-quality VIP advisors on the board.<br>
                                In addition to David, I have also brought influential ambassadors with large private
                                investor
                                networks.<br>
                                The aim is to be able to offer each ICO into these networks as part of a pre ICO public
                                sale.<br>
                                We are now preparing to do that for the Pindify ICO.<br>
                                I have also been preparing and queuing the other projects that will be added to the UCI
                                portfolio and I happy to report that we have secured these deals and will be doing ICOs
                                for each
                                of them.<br>
                                I will be sending you regular updates from now on to keep you informed regarding our
                                progress.<br>
