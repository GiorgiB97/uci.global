                        free to join and post social or promoted content, but as a paying member you can earn
                        subscription on your fans and your professional work. Subscription is $11/month (USA) and after
                        VAT and operational cost, the market distribution is about $ 9 / month and subscriber. Members
                        can join together to share, or separately earn, from both portfolio-revenue and content-revenue.
                        Portfolio earns about $2/month for every invited subscriber and about $2.50/month for every
                        follower divided by how many professional portfolios the subscriber follows. Content receives
                        revenue on the percentage of time subscribers reads, views or listens to it. Pindify currently
                        works on a joint blockchain technology to facilitate legal dynamic ownership contracts with
                        other providers, PROs, Aggregators and Labels/Agencies. It’s easy for anyone to enter, interact
                        and transact on the marketplace. The market has a global and local feed for providers to
                        promote. It’s regulated by a democratic ranking system to enforce quality. It’s free to support
                        and view free or promoted content, but subscribers paying a monthly subscription gets exclusive
                        access to portfolios content and full access to the market.</p>
